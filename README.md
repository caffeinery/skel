# Caffeinery Skeleton

Every Caffeinery project from now on intends to build with webpack and babel, and because it's probably best to do this, we made a sort of /etc/skel for our products to re-use with some custom configuration along the way. Caffeinery can then kind of look after this skeleton as we learn more as well as keeping the repos up to date.


## I have a suggestion!

We'd love to hear about it! Send a PR or submit an issue and we'll take a look at your suggestion - we intend to use this internally but it's also very good if people feel inspired to make something with this skeleton of a project, and suggest improvements we can change for the future!
